I'm Milagros N. Cortez (Mili). I am a student pursuing a Master's in Mathematics and Statistics specializing in Biostatistics at the University of Alberta. My main interests are genetic statistics, data visualization, neuroimaging, non-linear dynamics, and machine learning. My short-term goal is to gain experience in the field. 

Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I like to travel, hike, take pictures with my DSLR camera, draw, read, and learn Japanese. I have lived in Quito-Ecuador for 15 years, and in Canada for over 7 years, where I currently reside.
