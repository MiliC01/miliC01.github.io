I'm Milagros N. Cortez (Mili). I recently graduated with an MSc with a specialization in Statistics at the University of Alberta. My main interests are genetic statistics, data visualization, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. My short-term goal is to get into a master's program in biostatistics or data science and gain experience in the field. 

Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I like to travel, hike, take pictures with my DSLR camera, draw, read, and learn Japanese. I have lived in Quito-Ecuador for 15 years, and in Edmonton-Canada for over 6 years which is the place where I currently reside.
