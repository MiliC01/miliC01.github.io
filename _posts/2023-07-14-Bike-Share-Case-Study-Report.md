## About

This case study is meant to be an exercise to explore and analyze data for a fictional bike-share company from Chicago called
Cyclistic as part of the Google Data Analytics certificate. Using R to perform the analysis, we find differences between casual and
annual members' ride duration time, location, ride preference, and days of use.

## Process

For this project, we use R as the main program for analysis and data visualization. We start the project by looking at the data and metrics of the project. We then combine the data into one data set and clean it taking out rows with null values and specifying variables like time to be recognized by the program. Following the data-cleaning process, we ask the following questions:
- What is the overall distribution of ride time?
- What are the ride time distributions for each customer type?
- What is the customer volume for each day of the week, and what is the volume of each type for each day?
- Given the latitude-longitude coordinates for the start and end of each customer's ride, are there any differences between customer type and station locations across Chicago?
- Are all start-end locations registered as recognized stations?
- What type of rides have been used by customers, and are there any ride type differences between types of customers?

The analysis in this report aims to answer these questions and visualize our findings. We also include recommendations for the marketing branch on how to advertise the membership program of the company.
