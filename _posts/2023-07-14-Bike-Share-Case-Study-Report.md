## Abstract

This case study is meant to be an exercise to explore and analyze data for a fictional bike-share company from Chicago called
Cyclistic as part of the Google Data Analytics certificate. Using R to perform the analysis, we find differences between casual and
annual member's ride duration time, location, ride preference, and days of use.
