## About

This document explores optimizing the Ackley function through SRS, LRS, and ELRS, comparing the three methods, and using the Robins-Monro algorithm to model data from the R Nile dataset.

## Process

For the first part of the document, we optimize the Ackley function under the search domain [-32, 32]^d and compare the performance of three basic search methods - SRS, LRS, and ELRS - on this function in dimensions d=2,4,6. 

In the second part of the document, we model the Nile River using the Nile dataset package in R, the Robins, Monro Algorithm, loss functions, and gradient functions at d=2,4,6.
