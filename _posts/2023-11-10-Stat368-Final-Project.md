## About

This report was submitted in the Fall of 2021 as part of a group project for Stat 368 Design and Analysis of Experiments at the University of Alberta. The contributors to this project include Milagros N. Cortez, Sam Ulan, Siyi Chen, and Denzheng Kong. The project consisted of performing an experiment where we aimed to establish whether there is a particular brand that is more effective at enzymatically catalyzing the lactose present in milk under different types of milk fat content. For the experiment we used a Latin Square Design which allowed us to test and control for two blocking factors and one treatment factor.
