## About

This document is part of a series of assignments from Stat 413 (Computing for Data Science) which explores the curse of dimensionality by estimating the volume of a d-ball and computing the Bessel function using Monte Carlo sampling with uniform and beta distributions.

The course of dimensionality is a phenomena that occurs in high-dimensional spaces. In this project, we explore the volume of a hypersphere inside a hypercube. We note that as the dimension increases to five, we reach the largest volume of a hypersphere in a hypercube of the same dimensionality. As we increase the number of dimensions after 5, the volume of a hypersphere decreases drastically while the volume of a hypercube continues to increase.
