## About

This is a report of a fourth year group project where we had to create an algorithm to estimate the area of nations. The algorithm achieves this by stimulating latitude and longitude points from the surface of the Earth
and using a lookup table to match it to the country. Given a countryâ€™s name as input, the algorithm reports the estimated area of that country, along with a 90% confidence bound around that estimate.
