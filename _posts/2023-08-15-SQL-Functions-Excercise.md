## About
[link to the project](https://github.com/MiliC01/SQL-Business-Analysis)

In this project, we use SQL to analyze data designed for business analysis which can be found in Kaggle under the name of [Business Analysis (junior)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sticktogethertm/business-analysis-junior) uploaded by Igor Panteleev.
The data set is in a .xlsx file and divided into two data sets named 2019 and 2020. 

## Process
Given that the data has null values, we clean the data sets and then do basic and intermediate SQL functions to practice using SQL. Then, we answer the following questions to analyze the data:

1) How many new clients are in 2020?
   
2) How much did the seller earn on new products in 2020?

3)  Find the first three products with the biggest increase in 2020 compared to 2019

4)  What other observations can you get from the data?
